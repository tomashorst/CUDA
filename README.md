# CUDA
Code projects implemented using CUDA for Instituto Balseiro

This repository contains code examples and projects implemented using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that allows developers to harness the power of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for general-purpose computing tasks. The code in this repository showcases various CUDA programming techniques, including parallel algorithms, data parallelism, memory management, and GPU acceleration. These examples provide valuable insights into leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA implementing C++ and Python.
